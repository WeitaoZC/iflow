Conclusion:
1. the generated velocity seems smaller than true value which makes the generated trajectory couldn't reach the converging point. However, we can generate 2 times of the original points, so that the trajectory is compelete.

If we generate more points, the trajectory still converge at the fimal points, which indicates that our model is stable.

2.proper initilization makes the error lower, but also needs longer training time.
